The '''SMS ''Elbing''''' was a [[Germany|German]] ''Pillau'' class [[light cruiser]], named after the East Prussian city of Elbing.  Intended for the Russian navy under the name ''Admiral Newelski'' (named after [[Gennady Nevelskoy|the discoverer of the insularity of Sakhalin]]), the ship was built at F. [[Schichau-Werft]] in [[Danzig]] in 1913-1914.  Following the outbreak of [[World War I]], the ship was confiscated and launched on 21 November 1914 as the SMS ''Elbing''.
