'''Edsger Wybe Dijkstra''' (May 11, 1930 – August 6, 2002; {{IPA-nl|ˈɛtsxər ˈwibə ˈdɛɪkstra|-|Dijkstra.ogg}}) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[computer science|computer scientist]]. He received the 1972  [[Turing Award]]  for fundamental contributions to developing programming languages, and was the Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Sciences at The [[University of Texas at Austin]] from 1984 until 2000.

Shortly before his death in 2002, he received the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on [[self-stabilization]] of program computation. This annual award was renamed the [[Dijkstra Prize]] the following year, in his honour.
