'''Ceawlin''' (also spelled '''Ceaulin''' and '''Caelin''', died ''c.'' 593) was a King of [[Wessex]]. He may have been the son of [[Cynric of Wessex]] and the grandson of [[Cerdic of Wessex]], whom the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' represents as the leader of the first group of [[Saxons]] to come to the land which later became [[Wessex]]. Ceawlin was active during the last years of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] by the time of his death.

The chronology of Ceawlin's life is highly uncertain. The historical accuracy and dating of many of the events in the later ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' have been called into question, and his reign is variously listed as lasting seven, seventeen, or thirty-two years.<ref>Stenton, p. 29, accepts the date given for Ceawlin's accession in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 560, but Barbara Yorke in her online DNB article on Ceawlin states that his reign seems to have been deliberately lengthened.</ref> The Chronicle records several battles of Ceawlin's between the years 556 and 592, including the first record of a battle between different groups of Anglo-Saxons, and indicates that under Ceawlin Wessex acquired significant territory, some of which was later to be lost to other [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].  Ceawlin is also named as one of the eight "''[[bretwalda]]s''", a title given in the Chronicle to eight rulers who had overlordship over southern Britain, although the extent of Ceawlin's control is not known.

Ceawlin died in 593, having been deposed the year before, possibly by his successor, [[Ceol of Wessex|Ceol]].  He is recorded in various sources as having two sons, Cutha and [[Cuthwine]], but the genealogies in which this information is found are known to be unreliable.
